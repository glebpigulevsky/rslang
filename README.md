**Travis CI** - a continuous integration platform, supports development process by **automatically building and testing code changes**. Providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other parts of your development process by managing deployments and notifications. Highly recommended for use. **It is free** for open source projects.

**Deploy Previews in Netlify** - allow you and your team to see what changes will look like in production, without having to deploy them in your existing site. Deploy Previews work by **deploying every pull request from your Git repository to a unique URL**; completely different from the one your main site uses. You and your team can see how those changes look before they’re merged into the main branch and deployed to production.
